		<h1>Life as of Now</h1>
		<p>Currently, I attend Bartlett high school as a senior. After high school, I plan to attend the University of Memphis. I recently turned in  an application to them. The average high school GPA for an admitted freshman is a 3.33, and I tend to keep mine above that. I want to major in Civil Engineering, and hopefully find a well paying job in that field. </p>
