	<h1>What is a  Civil Engineer?</h1>
	<p>Civil engineers design, build, and supervise infrastructure projects and systems. The work environment consists of a variety of locations and conditions. It is common for employees to split their time between working in an office and working outdoors at construction sites so that they can monitor operations or solve problems onsite. Most civil engineers work full time.</p>

	<h1>What Does it Take to Become a Civil Engineer? </h1>
	<p>To be a civil engineer, it requires bachelorâ€™s degree in civil engineering, in one of its specialties, or in civil engineering technology. They typically need a graduate degree and licensure for promotion to senior positions. Licensure requirements vary by state, so most civil engineers usually are licensed if they provide services directly to the public. The median annual salary for civil engineers is $86,640.</p>
